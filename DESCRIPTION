Description: Our algorithm includes the following two parts. In the first part we propose a model selection criterion called structural Bayesian information criterion
  (SBIC) in which the prior structure is modeled and incorporated into the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). It is shown
  that the popular extended BIC (EBIC) is a special case of SBIC. In second part we propose a two-step algorithm to construct
  the candidate model pool. The algorithm is data-driven and the prior structure is embedded into the candidate model
  automatically.
