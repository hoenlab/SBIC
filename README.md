R-package implementation for the method presented in the paper "Information Enhanced Model Selection for High-Dimensional Gaussian Graphical Model with Application to Metabolomic Data" by Zhou et al. 2020. 

The purpose of this package is to provide a model selection process using the GBIC criterion using the 


Package can be installed using the `remotes` package
